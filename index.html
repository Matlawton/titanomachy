    <!-- This is my first time outside of school 15 years ago that i have used HTML.
    I built my first website with HTML and CSS by watching and re-watching the RMIT course
    webinars on collaborate ultra and by completing the Scrimba HTML and CSS course.
    As much as i feel i have already learnt so much never knew i could, I learnt how to build this website by writing and learning as i was watching the webinars and the scrimba course and I am excited to see what I can make when i am confident enough to not go back and re watch the tutorials from RMIT instructors and use my own brain to create something!.

    <h2>An introduction to myself and my interest in IT.</h2>
      <p>As far back as I can remember I have always wanted to help people, build things, fix things, be creative and make people happy. Living my life alongside these principles have led to many amazing opportunities, countries, people, characters, conversations and perspectives that has led me here to RMIT.</p>
      <p>A person who has constantly inspired and amazed me throughout my journey of life is Nikola Tesla, he was the first person who I could not understand and really sparked my curiousity for science and technology.</p>
      Learning about basic electrical currents in primary school was a memorable experience, during High School my friends and I became involved in BMX and fell in love with the culture that surrounded it and in our small coastal town of Western Australia I started making T-shirts and stickers at home that I sold at school, I used the money to buy bus tickets so we could all go on road trips to the big smoke(Perth, W.A.) for BMX competitions. 10 years later I was the owner/operator of Australia’s second largest BMX manufacturer and distributor to over 27 countries, <a href= "https://www.temperedgoods.com"> Tempered Bikes pty ltd.</a>
      </p>
      <p>I have never stopped wanting to help people, build things, fix things and make people happy and I have never stopped being inspired by Nikola Tesla, Carl Sagan, nature, space, people innovating healthcare, stories of courage and articles about women and men who make great impacts in the world by sometimes starting somewhere small.</p>
      <p>And here I am, a student at RMIT!</p>
      <p>By the way, how was Nikola Tesla able to predict the internet?</p>
      <p>During my time with RMIT I will work towards completing a bachelor’s degree in Computer Science, meet new people and endeavour to build a strong network of support within the IT communities and my peers at RMIT for a better future for my Family, friends and everyone I haven’t met yet who will inspire me in new ways to help me learn and achieve my goal of becoming a Software Developer within the Australian Healthcare industry.

  <h4>Myers-Briggs Online test results</h4>
      <img src="images/M-lawton-16p-results.jpg" alt= "Results from my Myers-Briggs online test.">
      <p class="test-results">I did not know what a protagonist was until I took the Myers-Briggs test.
I don’t believe these results will influence my behaviour to change in a team environment, I have always taken the time to consider the thoughts and ideas of my peers. I believe that being a great member of a team means that everybody should have an equal opportunity to express their ideas and thoughts therefore I do not believe my results really matter or would influence my outlook on teamwork.

<p><strong>Learning Styles test results.</strong></p>

<p> Check out the full results by <a href="https://personalitymax.com/report/?ls=69-74-77&name_key=4872e1e1b6"> Clicking Here.</p>
</a>
<p class="test-results">I think these results are great, it shows me how I learn, and which styles may be more beneficial to me, knowing this can be great.
I believe it shows that I am able to use all forms of learning and use these methods to tackle issues that may arise within the team environment and be able to support my peers more efficiently.
</p>
<p><strong>Situational Judgement test results.</strong></p>
<img src="images/s-judge-test.jpg" alt= "Results from my situational judgement online test.">
<p class="test-results">I think these results are also great, it shows me that I can be very helpful in some situations.
I don't believe these results will change the way I think about team work at all, I believe these results show that I may be able to help overcome certain situations.
</p>

</p>
<p><strong>Non-Verbal Aptitude test results.</strong></p>
<img src="images/non-verbal-results.jpg" alt= "Results from my Non-Verbal Aptitude online test.">
<p class="test-results">I took this test because I felt like this may be a weak area for me and something I could work towards over the course of my time at RMIT, I was pleased with my results and I think this shows I may be able to offer more support within a team environment than I originally thought, but still something I need to work at.
